## Features
- **Event Management**: Add, view, and delete events with priority levels (High, Medium, Low) and recurrence options.
- **Categorized Events**: Filter events by All, Personal, Work, or Urgent categories.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Periodic polling to refresh the event list automatically.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop and mobile devices with a dark mode toggle.
- **Calendar View**: Placeholder for a future calendar integration (to be enhanced).

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Git**: Install from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- **Java**: JDK 17 or higher (e.g., OpenJDK or Oracle JDK).
- **Gradle**: Version 8.14.3 or compatible (bundled with the project).
- **Node.js** (optional): For frontend development, though not required for this setup.
- **Web Browser**: Modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge) for running the app.

### Steps
1. **Clone the Repository**
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Event-Reminder-System.git
cd Event_Reminder_System

2. **Install Dependencies**
- No additional dependencies are required as Gradle handles backend dependencies.
- Ensure the `.gradle` folder is ignored (handled by `.gitignore`).

3. **Run the Backend**
- Open a terminal in the project directory.
- Start the server:
./gradlew run
- The backend will run on `http://localhost:8081`.

4. **Run the Frontend**
- In another terminal, navigate to the `web` folder:
cd web
python -m http.server 3000
- Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## Usage
1. **Manage Events**
- Add events using the form with a title, date/time, priority, and optional description.
- Filter events by category (All, Personal, Work, Urgent) or sort them.
- Delete events with the "Delete" button.

2. **Toggle Dark Mode**
- Click the "Theme" button in the header to switch between light and dark modes.

3. **View Calendar**
- The calendar view is a placeholder (to be enhanced later).
